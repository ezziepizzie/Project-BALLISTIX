1. Game Description:
- Play as B-4 and switch between different states with different physics settings 
  to navigate through the level, solve puzzles, and locate the exit.

2. Controls:
- Movement: [A] and [D] 
- Jump: [Spacebar]
- Switch States: [J] (AERIS), [K] (POWERIS), [L] (IMPACTIS)
- Dash: [Left Shift]
- Grapple: [F]
- Exit: [E] 
- Toggle camera: [C]
- Pause game: [Esc]

3. Ball States Description:
- Aerial State (AERIS): Light, fast, and bouncy. Can jump high and use jump pads.
- Power State (POWERIS): Heavy, slow, but strong. Push crates and activate switches.
- Impact State (IMPACTIS): Destructive. Able to dash to destroy obstacles.

4. Game Objective:
- Solve puzzles using different ball states, collect cards and locate the exit.

5. Ability:
- When near a grappling point, use [F] to attach and detach the grapple to the attach point. 
  Use [A] and [D] to swing and [Space] to jump from it.

6. Environmental Hazards:
- Lasers can be static, rotating, or swinging. Avoid touching it to prevent death.
- Turrets shoots in a linear path. Getting shot will result in death.
- See-Saws are imbalanced platforms which can be balanced out using different ball state.
